#Introduction:
This project introduces functions through a colourful modern art generator. Functions are used to package useful turtle graphics code which can then easily be used to create funky art. 

#Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ ['Turtle Race' starting point -- jumpto.cc/modern-go](http://jumpto.cc/modern-go)

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ [‘Modern Art’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/9339862606](https://trinket.io/python/9339862606)

#Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ modern-art/modern-art.py
+ modern-art/snippets.py

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ modern-art-finished/modern-art.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

#Learning Objectives
+ Functions;

#Challenges
+ Turtle art - define a new function to complete the turtle art generator.
+ More modern art - create a new function that calls other functions to generate modern art. 


#Frequently Asked Questions
+ To avoid having to wait for earlier code to run when adding to the project children can comment out code using a '#' at the beginning of a line. 
+ If they do want all of their code to run then `clear()` can be used to clear the screen.
