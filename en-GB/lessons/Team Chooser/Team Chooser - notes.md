#Learning Objectives
+ Lists;
+ Loading list data from a file.

#Challenges
+ "Adding more players" - adding elements to a `players` list;
+ "Choosing for team B" - creating a new `teamB` list to add random players to;
+ "Random team names" - creating and using a new `teamNames` list to assign random names to teams;
+ "Storing team names" - storing team names in a file, and loading them into a `teamNames` variable;
+ "More teams" - splitting players into 3 teams instead of 2.
